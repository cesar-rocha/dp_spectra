This repository contains codes, notebooks, and links to data for "Mesoscale to submesoscale wavenumber spectra in Drake Passage" by C. B. Rocha, T. K. Chereskin, S. T. Gille, and D. Menemenlis (submitted to JPO).

Codes developed and used in this project are available in the **src** directory. The most important codes were collected into a legit Python package, [**pyspec**](https://github.com/crocha700/pyspec). The repository for this package contains documentation, tests, and IPython notebooks showcasing the use of the most common functions.
